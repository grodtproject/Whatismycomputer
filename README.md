# Whatismycomputer
Creating an API for a website where someone can go to whatismycomputer.com and it will automatically generate computer name, manafacture, model, year,
serial number, product id, memory, storage, chipset, and other specifications.


The website needs to be kind of like fast.com which checks internet speeds or whats my ip which checks your computer IP,

a simple site where it just gives us all the info we need about the device 

needs to work with all OS for mobile, tablets, and computer devices.
